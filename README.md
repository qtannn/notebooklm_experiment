# NotebookLM Functionality Tests
This repository documents the results of testing different capabilities of NotebookLM. Each experiment was carried out to assess NotebookLM's effectiveness in tasks such as summarization, contextual question-answering, interactive note-taking, and content synthesis. Detailed outcomes, observations, and conclusions for each functionality are organized within their corresponding folders.

## Repository Structure
The repository is organized by functionality, with each functionality test stored in its folder:

- **Summarization** (/summarization): Tests NotebookLM's ability to generate concise summaries for complex documents.
- **Question-Answering** (/contextual_qanda): Evaluates NotebookLM's effectiveness in answering specific questions about document content.
- **Interactive Note-taking** (/notetaking): Assesses NotebookLM's capacity to generate note-taking and content augmentation based on provided notes
- **Content Synthesis** (/content_synthesis): Tests the ability to synthesise content across the provided documents. 

## Experiment Details
Each folder contains:

- Experiment Documentation: Markdown files (e.g., experiment_1.md) that document each test, including:
- Objective: What each test aims to assess.
- Methodology: Steps and parameters used in the experiment.
- Results: Observations and findings.
- Conclusion: Summary of the feature’s performance.
- References: Relevant links and references for further details.

## Results Summary
Below is a summary of each functionality test:

- Summarization Test: The language model can effectively distil key points, main arguments, and conclusions from the text. However, summarizations might miss critical context or oversimplify important technical concepts.
- Question-Answering Test: NotebookLM can provide accurate responses for straightforward questions but is less precise with complex, multi-part questions.
- Interactive note-taking Test: NotebookLM may not be as effective for highly specialized or niche subjects where the augmentation is based on general content rather than domain-specific knowledge.
- Content Synthesis Test: NotebookLM can synthesise the content well but misses some nuanced differences between the sources.
